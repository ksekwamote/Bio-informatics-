# Bio-informatics-
Bioinformatics practical exercises, coded in Julia
#Kutlo Sekwamote
These are practical excercizes that were coded in Julia. There are many more exercises like this that i have attempted with regard to bioinformtatics, but i think these are the more relevant ones, all you have to do is run the file in Jupyter or any other IDE for Julia. They work well with the latest version of Julia.
